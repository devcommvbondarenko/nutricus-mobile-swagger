Swagger 2.0 specification for a RESTful Web service.

I would like you to create a [Swagger 2.0](http://swagger.io/) specification for this project. Example is in the repository.

Use any tool you like. I suggest [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/). Push changes to the repository for a review.

I may give you SSH access to the repository.
